# The Swedish High Court (SeHC) Database

_Johan Lindholm, Mattias Derlén, and Daniel Naurin_

------------------

## Introduction

The database contains data on the Swedish high courts, more specifically the Supreme Court (“Högsta domstolen” or “HD”) and the Supreme Administrative Court (“Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen”, previously “Regeringsrätten”, or “HFD”). It contains data on both the judgments of the Supreme Court (presented for example in cases, opinions), as well as on the individual Justices that have served on the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court (presented in the table appointments).

The database has been collected as part of a research project involving researchers at the Department of Law at Umeå University and the Department of Political Science at Gothenburg University. The creation of the database was made possible with the financial support of the Swedish Research Council (project number 2018–1383). We also want to express our gratitude to our research assistants at Umeå University for their invaluable help in compiling the data: Erik Engman Jonsson, Thomasine Francke Rydén, Angelica Kullström, Carl Lexenberg, Malin Thorneman, and Juni Wikman.

If you have any questions regarding the data, the coding process, or commercial use of the data, please contact Johan Lindholm (johan.lindholm@umu.se).
